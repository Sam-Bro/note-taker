> Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes 

 This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This project was built because it is important to demonstrate knowledge of express . The Note Taker helps solve the problem of using physical notes. In the duration of this project, I learned that I need to take a deeper look into express and such.
